The SoilAttribute_src datasets provide information on the source of the data and hence indicates quality of the individual soil attribute datasets. The values of the source datasets are as follow:

-2 = Digital Atlas of Australian Soils (1:2000000 scale mapping)
3 = ASRIS Level 3 (approximately 1:1000000 scale mapping)
4 = ASRIS Level 4 (approximately 1:250000 scale mapping)
5 = ASRIS Level 5 (approximately 1:100000 scale mapping)

The ASRIS Level 5 data is the most detailed mapping (value 5) through to the Atlas of Australian Soils which is the broadest scale mapping (value 2).
